# Phase 3 - Instruction & Acknowledgement
### Instruction
-  
- There are several accounts for testing purpose. If you get tired of our secured registration process, please feel free to use any of them. Passwords are all set to 12345678 by default.
    
###Acknowledgement
- To avoid the possible delay caused by SMTP middleware, all the account are set "activated=true" currently, which means that you can directly log in to the account without checking the email for activation after registration. Nevertheless, you can still check the email for trial.
- The functionality of uploading the picture for profile and email notification are still in consideration, since they're a bit useless currently. And We just leave them on the webpage.
